Most of my project is explained in the HTML write up, and there isn't really anything additional I feel I need to explain here. I think my code correctly preforms the filtering process. It preserves resolution by padding with reflected image content. It supports any filter size because the size of the padding is taken from the size of the filter passed into my_imfiter. It handles colored images by filtering each of the color channels individually and then adding the channels back together.
