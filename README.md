ComputerVisionProjects
======================

Old projects from Computer Vision

Proj1: Creating hybrid images by using a low pass and high pass gaussian kernel. 

Proj2: Detecting interest points using harris corner detecter and then gathering SIFT features to match interest points in
images of the same scene/object from different view points. 

Proj3: Scene classification using bag of words model, k-nearest neighbors and clustering. I also implemented spatial 
pyramid matching to boost accuracy. 

Proj4: Facial recognition using a sliding window technique and a linear SVM. 

Proj5: Implemented the pipeline in the sketch tokens paper. This used a sliding window technique, clustering, and a random forest
classifier. I was able to beat canny edge detector and sobel edge detector.
