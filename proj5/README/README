There isn't much to tell you about this project that isn't in the write up. Note that I did compute self similarity features, but I commented out all calls to my self_similarity function because computing self similarity features at every pixel of each test images is incredibly slow. If you guys have to run our projects then you probably don't want to run mine with self similarity.
