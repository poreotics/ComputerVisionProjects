% Local Feature Stencil Code
% CS 143 Computater Vision, Brown U.
% Written by James Hays

% This script 
% (1) Loads and resizes images
% (2) Finds interest points in those images                 (you code this)
% (3) Describes each interest point with a local feature    (you code this)
% (4) Finds matching features                               (you code this)
% (5) Visualizes the matches
% (6) Evaluates the matches based on ground truth correspondences

% There are numerous other image sets in /course/cs143/asgn/proj2/data/
% You can simply download images off the Internet, as well. However, the
% evaluation function at the bottom of this script will only work for this
% particular image pair (unless you add ground truth annotations for other
% image pairs). It is suggested that you only work with these two images
% until you are satisfied with your implementation and ready to test on
% additional images. A single scale pipeline works fine for these two
% images (and will give you full credit for this project), but you will
% need local features at multiple scales to handle harder cases.

% All of the coordinates are being divided by scale_factor because of the

% will only work for the particular Notre Dame image pair specified in the
% starter code. You can, however, use 'collect_ground_truth_corr.m' to
% build ground truth for additional image pairs and then change the paths
% in 'evaluate_correspondence' accordingly. Or you can simply comment out
% this function once you start testing on additional image pairs.
