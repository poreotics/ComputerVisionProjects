There are no known bugs. My average precision didn't exceed 90% and I am not sure if it is due to a small bug or if I just didn't train my SVM/tune parameters well enough. My project is pretty straight forward, there were no major design choices that were different from what was described in the handout. 

I don't really know what else to write here so... derp.
