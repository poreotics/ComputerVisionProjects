My project is pretty straight forward. I implemented all of the versions of the pipeline and spatial matching for extra credit. I also wrote an RBF kernel for my SVM right before I handed this in to see if it would get my accuracy up to 80%, but something is clearly wrong. It only achieves about 50% with my bag of words implementation. It's possible its just parameter tuning. I left the code in my SVM function but didn't include any of the numbers in my writeup because they were so low.
